I wanted to make a user-friendly e-commerce website. I chose mugs and cups because 99% of my friends love coffee breaks. All the mugs and cups are my imaginary creation with the assistance of AI. My favourites are forest-themed portable cups. 
Users can click "Add basket" button to store items they like in the shopping basket. The shopping basket can be edited using a delete button.

11/06/23 I added mobile responsive features.<br/>
14/06/23 Added "bespoke" form page. When a user submit a form, I will receive the form input via email. </br>
15/0623 Added "bespoke sample" page</br>

Next Step: Adding "sort by category"
