# CuriosityMugs

I wanted to make a user-friendly e-commerce website. I chose mugs and cups because 99% of my friends love coffee breaks. All the mugs and cups are created by me with the assistance of AI. These are my fantasy mugs and cups - my favourites are forest-themed portable cups on the second row. 
Users can click "Add basket" button to store items they like in the shopping basket. The shopping basket can be edited using a delete button.
