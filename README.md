# CuriosityMugs

I wanted to make a user-friendly e-commerce website. I chose mugs and cups because 99% of my friends love coffee breaks. All the mugs and cups are my imaginary creation with the assistance of AI. My favourites are forest-themed portable cups. 
Users can click "Add basket" button to store items they like in the shopping basket. The shopping basket can be edited using a delete button.

11/06/23 I added mobile responsive features.
Next step: To create a form where users can submit what sort of mugs they would like to see on my shop. Their submission will be sent to my email account.
